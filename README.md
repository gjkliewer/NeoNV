# NeoNV
NeoNV is a note taking app inspired by the excellent [Notational Velocity](https://notational.net/) but with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) powering the text editor.

**Warning:** NeoNV is still in development, be sure to back up any files being edited.

## TODO
Features:
- navigate file list using 'j' and 'k'
- brew install NeoNV with nvim
- better app icon

Bugs:
- File list doesn't refresh after adding a new file
- tab currently doesn't work within editor (changes focus)
